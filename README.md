🚀 Excited to share that I've successfully completed the projects assigned to me during my 𝐖𝐞𝐛 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩  with TechnoHacks EduTech Official📱💻 

 

#Project1: Currency Converter 

My first project was a simple but powerful currency converter. It let users input any amount and instantly see it converted to various currencies. 

 

#Project2: Calculator 

Next, I built a basic calculator app. From addition and subtraction to more complex operations. It was a satisfying exercise in making something practical and user-friendly. 

 

#Project3: Registration form 

Moving on to front-end forms, I built a registration form with validation features. This project taught me about form elements, input validation rules, and error handling.

 

#Project4: Basic landing page 

Finally, I create a simple and basic landing page. This involved HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design the layout, add animations, and implement basic interactivity.
